# Introduction 
Ketone (Ke-T-ON = Keras-Tensorflow-ONNX) enables you convert the keras models into [ONNX](https://onnx.ai).
Initially Keras converter was developer in the project onnxmltools. To support more kinds of keras models and reduce the complexity of mixing multiple converters, ketone was created to convert the keras model only. 

Ketone supports the keras lambda/custom layer by parsing the TF graph built from Keras model.
More intro will be coming soon...
